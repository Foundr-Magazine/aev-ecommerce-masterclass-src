                <p>Within just 6 months of starting her first online store, Gretta was making $600,000 USD per month in
                    sales (without funding or investment). She then cofounded another online store that generated
                    $100,000 USD on it's the first day!</p>
                <p>So far Gretta had been responsible for two multimillion dollar ecommerce brands... she had been
                    wildly successful twice, but could she do it again?</p>
                <p>She simplified her approach into a framework that she followed two more times. Turning each new
                    ecommerce business into a multimillion dollar success story. Gretta now had a proven method for
                    starting (and scaling) online stores in any niche.</p>
                <p>She has seen million dollar sales days for her online stores and just celebrated 5 years since she
                    started her first successful ecommerce store from her kitchen (and yes, it's still going strong!).
